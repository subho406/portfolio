Hey there, I'm an aspiring researcher currently persuing MSc Computer Science (thesis-based) at the University of Alberta. I am also working as a teaching assistant under Prof. Adam White for CMPUT 365 (Reinforcement Learning 1). Previously I had worked with IBM Cloud as an ML Engineer and also collaborated with IBM Research over various research projects in representation learning. I want to explore the theoritical depths of Cognitive Science and AI, and contribute inches towards safe AGI. I'm also an avid coder, and have experience in deployment of several machine learning algorithms at scale in IBM and Kone. My current research interests include but not limited to:

* Reinforcement Learning
* Representation Learning
* Multi-modal & Multi-task learning (NLP + Vision)
* Deep learning
