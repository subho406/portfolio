Hey there, I am a MSc student at the University of Alberta working on Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I am currently co-supervised by [Adam White](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/) and [Marlos Machado](http://mcmachado.info), and affliated with [RLAI Lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca) and [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)](https://www.amii.ca). Previously I had worked with IBM Cloud as an ML Engineer and also collaborated with IBM Research over various research projects in representation learning. I'm also an avid coder, and have experience in deployment of several machine learning algorithms at scale in IBM and Kone.

My current research interests include but not limited to:

* Reinforcement Learning
* Representation Learning
* Multi-modal & Multi-task learning (NLP + Vision)
* Deep learning
